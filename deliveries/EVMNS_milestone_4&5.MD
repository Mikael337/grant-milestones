* **Milestone Number:** 4 & 5

**Context:**
For execution of Milestone 4 & 5

**Deliverables:**

### Overview of the smart contract's functionalities:

- Domain Registration: Allows users to register unique domain names on EVMNS.
- Domain Management: Enables users to manage their registered domain names, such as changing the domain's profile,
  changing the resolver, modifying TLS certificates, and more.
- Domain Transfer: Allows users to transfer their registered domain names to others.
- Resolver Registration: Allows users to select a resolver to interpret the domain name. Depending on the resolver, the
  domain name can support different functions.
- Domain Resolution: Allows users or third-party dApps to query the profile content of any EVMNS domain name, for
  instance, to check whether an EVMNS domain name is associated with an EVM address.

### Additional Information

EVMNS's various tasks have been mostly completed and it is in a state ready for release. So we merge Milestone 4 and Milestone 5 for submission. We hope merging the milestones is feasible and won't cause any other issues. Thank you very much!
